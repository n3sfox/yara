Set of YARA rules for detecting various malware families. Rules are intendent for scanning of memory images or processes on live system - after malware is fully unpacked and has injected its code into other processes.

All rules were created to the best of my knowledge and tested on at least a few samples. 

Would you find any errors please let me know! <n3sfox(at)gmail.com>
